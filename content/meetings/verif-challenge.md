Unfortunately this meeting was not record (my bad).

We discussed the specifications for a few simple functions in [Prusti](https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev) and [Creusot](github.com/xldenis/creusot). 
There were quite a few things to say on how we handle borrows and the differences between the two tools.

A summary will be posted soon. 

The slides are [here](./previous-events/october.pdf)
