Ferrocene is an effort to bring Rust into the realm of safety-critical software while also bringing tangible benefits to so called mission-critical efforts. The project has been ongoing for about a year now. This talk will give an overview of current findings and particularly an observation of the current state of the safety-critical ecosystem.

Particularly, it will share observations on the application of formal methods in the realm right now.
